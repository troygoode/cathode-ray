## Getting Started

This project was created with [NextJS](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To install this project, open a terminal window and `cd` into the repo's directory, then run

### `npm install`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the linter on the project. This will check for any linting errors in the codebase.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the production mode (you must have run `npm run build` first).<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
